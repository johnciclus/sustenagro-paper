\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural production systems have the need of measuring sustainability,
 an approach to achieve this goal is the use of Sustainable Indicators (ISDs).
 With the aiming to develop a new methodology and a software system that
 are able to access the sustainability of Sugarcance production system in
 Brazil, was developed the SustenAgro Project.
 The main challenge was the formulation of specific sustainability indicators
 considering the complexity and diversity of agricultural scenario in this
 country.
 This propose uses Ontologies to represent indicators and organize the informati
on as the base for SustenAgro.
 his Project shows better and accurate results in comparison with others
 Knowledge Organization Systems used in the área.
 In this paper we present two ontologies and a Domain Specific Language
 (DSL) associated that support the decision making process and represent
 the domain knowledge, both based on Semantic Web technologies.
 This association proposes an architecture to implement and a manage Decision
 Making Systems like SustenAgro Software.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of a sustainability assessment method in agriculture is
 a latent requirement.
 Whereby, researchers of Embrapa Environment and scientific partners developed
 a sustainability assessment method, entitled SustenAgro Method.
 It focuses on the sugarcane production system in the center-south region
 of Brazil.
 This method allows the scientific community to integrate knowledge, related
 to sustainability, providing metrics and generating recommendations or
 strategies to improve sustainability.
 It also can be used to enable public policies formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sustainability assessment involves many environmental, social and economic
 aspects
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "alkan2009goal"

\end_inset

.
 From this natural complexity arises the need to maintain a formal conceptual
 basis to organize and represent the knowledge concepts used by the team
 of experts.
 An ontology, a formal way to define the structure of knowledge for a domain,
 can be used to formalize these knowledge concepts.
 An ontology is a formal naming and definition of the types, properties,
 and interrelationships of the entities that exist in a particular domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SustenAgro Method uses an ontology to represent knowledge about sustainabili
ty in sugarcane.
 In this ontology, indicators are used to represent and measure complex
 aspects of sugarcane agricultural sustainability.
 They try to synthesise information about critical aspects of an agricultural
 production system.
 The scientific basis for the creation of SustenAgro's indicators was research,
 carried out by Embrapa Environment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "brunooliveira2013"

\end_inset

, to identify and define sustainability indicators for sugarcane production
 units (farms and production plants).
 Indicators have values, generally categorical, to indicate their status.
 For instance, such as biodiversity, soil fertility, water resources, among
 others.
 The method combines indicator values, using formulas and weights, to calculate
 two key indexes for sugarcane production units: the sustainability and
 efficiency indexes.
 The values of these indexes reflect a trade off between sustainability
 and efficiency and are used to determine which recommendations will be
 offered.
 Users should use the indexes and recommendations to develop their own strategie
s to increase sustainability in their production units.They are important
 to measure critical situations to prevent future problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SustenAgro Method was planned to be implemented as a web application
 and be available online for users.
 In a traditional development cycle, Embrapa Environment would hire a web
 developer contractor and give him mockups of the interfaces they wanted
 and the formulas they developed.
 Embrapa had, in the past, many problems with this development model.
 At this stage, the SustenAgro Method is just a plan with some mockups in
 PPT and formulas written in an Excel spreadsheet.
 A first system is designed after many trials and errors.
 Contractors are not domain experts on sustainability and that can lead
 to many errors and delays.
 After the first system is running, users will express their views, indicators
 may have to be redesigned, there will be changes to the ontology, etc.
 A modified system will have to be created and that can be repeated a number
 of time.
 Each cycle will be slow and expensive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A better solution would be a system where domain experts can directly express
 the ontology, they already created for SustenAgro, the formulas, to calculate
 the indexes, and their recommendations in a machine readable format.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we present how the SustenAgro System, a web-based Decision
 Support System (DSS) for the SustenAgro method, allow domain experts to
 create, by themselves, their ontologies, formulas and recommendations.
 It uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and graphic user interfaces specially
 designed for the use of domain experts.
 Using just the ontology and DSL programs, entered by the domain expert,
 the SustenAgro system is capable to automatically generate the application's
 user interface, get answers from logged users, calculate the indexes and
 show graphics and recommendations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach allows a faster development cycle for SustenAgro System.
 Domain experts have to learn to use the system and its associated DSL,
 but after that they can implement changes immediately (at runtime).
 The DSLs are compact and easy to learn, generating a tool for supporting
 the sustainability assessment process in sugarcane production systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool was analysed and tested by domain experts concluding that the
 SustenAgro system allows the re-definition of sustainability domain knowledge
 represented in the ontology and of the functionalities for generating the
 visual representation of this decision support system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Ontologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ontologies support the representation and organization of knowledge, allowing
 the concepts integration, even when they belong to domains without apparent
 relationship.
 In the SustenAgro system was necessary interrelate sustainability knowledge
 with graphical user interfaces knowledge, to support the generation of
 Decision Support Systems (DSS) for sustainability assessment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Expert knowledge was initially modeled through conceptual maps that facilitate
 a communication of concepts but increase the steps of modeling process,
 which was identified the need for a tool for supporting the domain expert's
 modeling of ontologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of ontologies were modeled by techniques of rapid prototyping
 of coverage and increased complexity, starting with the most relevant component
s of the model to the experts and incorporating each one of the other components
, these prototypes were validated through questions of expert interests
 and validate through queries and performs a validation and integration,
 this cyclical method obtains a prototype in each cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SustenAgro knowledge representation was divided into two ontologies,
 SustenAgro Ontology and DSS ontology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SustenAgro Ontology: sustainability assessment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SustenAgro ontology represents the base knowledge to perform a sustainability
 assessment of sugarcane production in Center-South of Brazil, it is composed
 of several concepts in the agronomic, economic, social, environmental areas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SustenAgro Ontology support concepts that are constantly changing, for
 example in the process of "sustainability assessment" the indicators and
 indexes are continuously redefined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental classes are Production Unit, Indicator, Variable, Value,
 Microregion, and so forth.
 Which are integrated and related to represent the domain of sustainability
 assessment in sugar-cane, below are presented the main classes of this
 ontology:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Production Unit class, represents the organizations that can be assessed
 by the SustenAgro system to obtain a sustainability measure, currently
 they can be sugar-cane providers and / or sugar-cane processing plants,
 each assessment process requires data that defines the Production Units
 through the properties that make up them, was defined a set of required
 properties for the production units: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Name: define the name of the production unit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Harvest year: define the year of harvest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Agricultural production system: relates the agricultural production system
 being assessed.
\end_layout

 are located, allowing to define the state and the microregion for the farms
 and plants related with sugar-cane, currently the SustenAgro system has
 7 states that belong to the center-south of Brazil and 243 microregions
 within the registered states, these data were semantically queried and
 integrated in the system from a query on DBpedia.

 of web semantic ontologies OWL, the classes were related through Object
 Properties and Data properties that allow to link syntactically the associated
 classes in the evaluation of sustainability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data and Object properties must have set the rdfs:range to accomplish the
 validation of related classes and some are functional to ensure a relation
 one-to-one.

Innova-Tec system: assessment of technological innovation impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Nano-Tec system: assessment of nanotechnological impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these systems were identified common elements, which were abstracted
 in the SAD ontology with the purpose to generalize the classes of sustenagro
 ontology, to provide the generation of graphical interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The identified and modeled classes are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 the SustenAgro case represents the possibles values that an Indicator or
 Variable may have, the discrete and defined elements as the categorical
 are modeled as class individuals, thereby enabling, restrict the options
 to choose from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6 presents the Value class and subclasses modeled, so much Categorical
 for finite set of values and Real for numeric values, as an example is
 Yes/no Class that represents the yes and no values, which are modeled as
 individuals of said class.
\end_layout

Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of semantic web ontologies was necessary to represent and organize
 the knowledge and so provides a well-defined structure adaptable to changes,
 however the ontologies lack flexibility to define specific procedures and
 settings.
 Whereby the alternative found to meet this gap is the use of a Domain Specific
 Language based on ontologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The developed architecture has two ontologies base:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
SustenAgro ontology has the knowledge representation of production units,
 sustainability indicators, sustainability variables, sustainability index,
 analyzes and geographical information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DSS ontology contains the main concepts for support the assessment process
 and provides datatypes mapping and support graphical user interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ontologies are instantiated in a triplestore that supports the storage and
 retrieval of information for the entire system.
 The expert user has access to system configuration through DSLs in which
 are presented according to terminology setup instructions used by the expert
 domain, allowing you to configure system features such as the data that
 make up an object of evaluation, the formulas of sustainability and graphic
 interfaces to present the results.
 Thus, the ‘manager-domain expert’ is able to make changes at any time the
 system is running.
\end_layout

For a good ontology is important that the concepts are well defined and
 for this and necessary to use techniques to detect semantic conflicts.
 Alcaraz et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 defines how to assemble scenarios in order to detect conflicts or problems
 that may have been made in the creation of ontology, the techniques described
 can be considered as a kind of reasoning that detects situations that was
 not explicit in the ontology.
 With this and other papers related to sustainability we can disambiguate
 and ensure the concepts are consistent and follow the expert needs.

For development of an ontology is important to understand the concepts involved
 and needs to create an ontology.
 Wen et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 describes about ontologies in computer science and generalized terms that
 are needed for development of ontologies, these terms were extremely important
 for all stages of creation and analysis of ontology.
 We do patterns in links between classes to try make more consistent the
 ontology.

\begin_layout Standard
SustenAgro Ontology have consulted sources of ontologies in the agricultural
 sector and on the assessment of sustainability.
 It was chosen two developments the "Agricultural ontology Service "which
 is a model for defining ontologies for agriculture based on AGROVOC which
 is a major agricultural vocabularies developed by FAO and the ontology
 of sustainability evaluation ISD-Economics ontology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that provides sustainability concepts.
 According with this research it was concluded that there is an ontology
 that integrates the concepts of sustainability assessment in agriculture.
 These two proposals state of the art will be integrated into SustenAgro
 Ontology in the following versions of the ontology, since the goal of this
 first version is the identification and definition of the fundamental concepts
 of sustainability assessment in the production of sugarcane system.

 was taken as the basis of knowledge and was chosen by the domain expert.
 Was taken all the knowledge base that was used as the indicators and the
 needs of each and still had part of integrated sustainability directly
 with the part of agriculture geared to the location of the Center-South
 of Brazil.
 It was analyzed with all the parts described in the dissertation by selecting
 indicators previously validated by a group of experts.

In order to eliminate ambiguity in semantic understanding and making mining
 the relationship between the concepts of knowledge in agriculture, should
 be combined with the knowledge among heterogeneous databases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It proposes a Agricultural Knowledge Grid[cuiping2013agricultural] which
 was built with three layers "Resource Layer", "Semantic Layer" and "User
 Layer", has been applied to "Semantic Extension on Retrieval", "Knowledge
 links" and "Experience" to deepen "Agricultural Knowledge Services".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AGROVOC is a controlled vocabulary that covers all areas of interest FAO
 and consists of 32,000 concepts available in 21 languages, this tool is
 used by researchers, librarians and information managers to index, retrieve
 and organize data in agricultural information systems.
 [lauser2006agrovoc] is an initiative that serves as a reference in structuring
 and standardization of agricultural terminology in multiple languages for
 use systems in agriculture, the purpose of this technology is to achieve
 more interoperability between agricultural systems.

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This system demonstrates how the integration of ontologies and dsl allows
 the definition of decision support systems that are adaptable to domain
 changes, the main result was the design of a method for creating and editing
 in real time DSS based on semantic technologies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The products of this project are the sustainablity assessment ontology,
 the DSL and the SustenAgro System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the results of this research we can emphasize the development of the
 conceptual map which established a means of communication between domain
 experts and specialists of ontologies, thus achieving the implementation
 of the concepts of ontology in computer language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach was chosen because it better fit into the context where it
 was being developed.
 Experts in the field of sustainability had not domain in ontology development
 tools and so would be costly teach them about it, making the conceptual
 map a more common means of communication throughout the team and when in
 the ontology needs experts knowledge they were introduced the necessary
 tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SustenAgro Ontology is the most relevant results in computational terms
 because it allows represent the expert's knowledge in a standard modeling
 elements, relations, axioms and rules of the modeled system, this representatio
n is flexible to change that is needed in this project since the domain
 is still in construction also supports information retrieval technologies.
 This ontology was developed using RDF.
 This was selected because it is a language created to define ontologies
 on the Web and also for a better understanding of the team that developed.
 Since there was a need for a data recovery system, it was essential that
 the ontology could adapt the semantic web technologies to optimize processes
 and adapt to the reality of sustainability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the ontology and the conceptual map the ontology was also
 adapted into a data recovery system type triplestore, which is the system
 used in the semantic web.
 Was chosen this type of system because besides the team's expertise in
 the technology, sustainability in itself already has some semantic baggage,
 which introduced into a scope own optimizes the analysis of sustainable
 processes and can communicate with other data systems, providing a greater
 range of concepts and analyzes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This base was made through the triplestore Blazegraph, this was already
 pre-configured on a server facilitating own use.
 The ontology was adapted to it and so tests were made based on data collected
 by experts to investigate the completeness and consistency of this ontology.
 For the evaluation of ontology were made consultations with experts to
 create them questions (paths), to answer certain concepts to see if this
 ontology was adjusting the nature of the data and that the very experts
 expected the ontology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this evaluation some adjustments were made to fix some flaws that
 had and to generally optimize the ontology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem addressed in this research was the design of a software architecture
 which allows to define and manage the sustainability assessment knowledge
 and graphical user interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem was identified in several software tools of Embrapa Environment,
 that need to be reconfigured to changing field of knowledge, supporting
 the reconfiguration of the data models and their graphical users interfaces
 management and presentation of information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the difficulties in modeling both the concept map as the ontology
 is to reach a consensus of critical concepts, which are the binding more
 than one area of expertise, for example in the modeling of the interface
 elements as the elements between the indicators and the assessment methodology,
 or between the elements of the plant variables and indicators, this is
 natural as each expert has a different view of the phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficulty is that the semantic web technologies for knowledge represent
ation are under development, which leads to incompatibilities of the various
 technologies, for example in the development of information retrieval system
 there are no software components that facilitate communication with the
 server part frameworks.
 And to validate this ontology, the experts have some difficult to define
 how the ontology have to work in some places to make the validation complete
 and make the ontology more reliable at the concepts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In defining the models must define what the purpose of it, which will guiding
 each of the discussions that arise when modeling is a complex phenomenon
 that can be interpreted in different ways by the experts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the technological development is important to note that the semantic
 web storage technologies provide more functionality beyond the information
 retrieval, so it is reasonable that the efficiency is lower in this case
 is necessary to assess the requirements and determine the most coherent
 architecture , which can be hybrid architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its important to define how the evaluation techniques will be used, because
 without a good validation, all of the methods may be invalid if it’s not
 have a validation well defined.
